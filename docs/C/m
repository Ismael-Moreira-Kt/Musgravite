## Manual versus Automatic
Before I go any further, you need to decide: do you want to do everything manually or use the installation scripts I've lovingly made? Although I think you're a monster and I'll never forgive you if you do it manually, I still need to give you some information before you decide to use the scripts I've made.

#### Advantages of using the library manually
You'll have more control over what's in your project and what isn't, as you can define your workflow and even which files will be kept or not.

#### Advantages of using automation scripts
Automation scripts have several advantages. They define a workflow automatically, creating _libs folders to add the library headers and scripts and _tests folders for... the tests? <br>
You can also create a make to compile the tests automatically with compilers like gcc and clang. <br>
Finally, they remove all the files that aren't necessary for your project, minimizing the space taken up.

## Use the library manually
Okay, knowing the advantages of each approach, if you still want to use it manually... I hate you, but I accept. 


#### Linux and MacOS
```bash
    mv musgravite/musgravite.hpp path/to/the/chosen/directory
    mv musgravite/'C Wrapper'/musgravite.h path/to/the/chosen/directory
    mv musgravite/'C Wrapper'/musgraviteImpl.cpp path/to/the/chosen/directory
```


#### Windows
```powershell
    Move-Item -Path "musgravite/musgravite.hpp" -Destination "path/to/the/chosen/directory"
    Move-Item -Path musgravite/'C Wrapper'/musgravite.h -Destination "path/to/the/chosen/directory"
    Move-Item -Path musgravite/'C Wrapper'/musgraviteImpl.cpp -Destination "path/to/the/chosen/directory"
```

<br>

## Use the library with installation script
The installation script is much simpler, but requires you to read the terminal. <br>
If you want to know more about what installers do, you can read the [installer guide](../Installers/).

#### Linux and MacOS
```bash
    chmod +x musgravite.sh
    ./musgravite.sh
```

#### Windows
```powershell
    ./musgravite.ps1
```

If there is a permission problem when running the script, you can follow this procedure.

```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
    ./musgravite.ps1
```
